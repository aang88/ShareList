# ShareList

My friends and I can never decide on what songs to play in the car. Thus, ShareList was born to combine two user's playlists on Spotify to make it easier for friends to discover songs they can both enjoy. The hope is that this website will create a mutual soundtrack to enhance the experience when hanging out with your friends, that way others will avoid situations that my friends and I have experienced.
